      <p>This review notes explores the inner workings of deep learning vs. traditional ML algorithms. While basic
      models struggle with complex patterns, deep networks, like a pair of neurons, can unlock hidden secrets via
      non-linear magic. Using math, code and mathematical intuition, we delve into their ability to capture curves
      and its relationships, leaving us eager to push the boundaries of understanding and unlock even deeper insights.</p>
